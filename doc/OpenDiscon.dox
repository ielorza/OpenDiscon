/** @mainpage
*
* OpenDiscon is <a href="http://www.ikerlan.es/en/">Ikerlan</a>'s open source implementation of popular wind turbine controller interfaces.
* based on <a href="http://www.ikerlan.es/en/">Ikerlan</a>'s open source wind turbine control software library @ref openwitcon.
*
* OpenDiscon is publicly available under a rather permissive @subpage license "license", so
* it may be used in many ways, possibly some of which have not been imagined by the authors.
* However, it provides some out-of-the-box implementations. Using them requires compilation and linking.
* CMake files are provided for easy production of the project files, makefiles or MATLAB functions suitable for the
* user's toolchain and options.
*
* To make the above happen, run <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> on the OpenDiscon directory.
* Two options are available:
* - CONFIGURATION
*  - CL-Windcon: a controller for @ref clwindcon
* - DISTRIBUTION
*  - DISCON: an implementation of the legacy GHBladed DISCON interface, which is also used by other wind turbine simulation software packages such as FAST.
*  - S-Function: a Simulink block implementation.
